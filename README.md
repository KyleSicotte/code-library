Code Library is where I dump all of the smaller, fun projects I've been working on for the rest of the world to improve and make even better.
Everything in this repository is licensed under CC0, so feel free to use it for anything you want. 
Hope you enjoy it. If you need any help working with this code, or have any suggestions for improvements or future code, feel free to contact me at kylesicotte.ca.
